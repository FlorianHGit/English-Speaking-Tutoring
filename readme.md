With the ENG-Speaking-Tutoring Website, we aim to enhance local accessibility.
Our goal is to present ourselves and make it easy for new customers to get in touch with us.
We believe presenting our service on the Internet will attract many new people.

### Validating HTML
To validate the HTML, I've utilized W3C HTML Validator. It gave me some error messages, but they are related to ARIA labels, so I think that's acceptable.

### Validating CSS
For validating the CSS, I've used W3C CSS Validator. It should be free of bugs.

### Unfixed Bugs
I'm aware of some that I can improve some of my commits.


## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will automatically refresh with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits
I made a lot of changes and added some new features, but I got inspiration for the header and navbar from the awesome 'Love Running Project' at [Codeinstitute.](https://codeinstitute.net)
